# Topological sorting
Alright, let's simplify!

Imagine you're trying to build a LEGO tower. Some LEGO pieces must be placed before others because they act as the base or foundation. Without the proper foundation, the tower might fall.

Topological sorting is like finding the correct order to place these LEGO pieces so your tower is stable and doesn't fall over.

For example, imagine you have three LEGO pieces: A, B, and C. 

- A is the base and should be placed first.
- B goes on top of A.
- C goes on top of B.

In this case, the order to place these LEGO pieces is A, B, C. If you tried placing C before A or B, the tower might fall or not even be possible to build!

Now, imagine these LEGO pieces as tasks or steps in a process. Just like building the LEGO tower, some tasks must be completed before others. Topological sorting helps find the right order to do these tasks.

But remember! If the LEGO pieces are all mixed up and some are dependent on pieces that are dependent on themselves (like a circle or loop), then we can't build our tower. Similarly, topological sorting only works when there's a clear order to follow, without any loops.

In short, topological sorting is like finding the right sequence to build something, ensuring each step is in the right order!
